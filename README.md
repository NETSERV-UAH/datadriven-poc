# Softwarized Data-Driven Architecture for Edge Computing IIoT Environments

This repository contains the implementation and supporting materials of a **softwarized, data-driven architecture** for **Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT)** environments. The architecture has been designed to operate seamlessly across the **Cloud/Edge/IIoT continuum**, enabling low-latency analytics, distributed intelligence, and adaptive reconfiguration based on real-time telemetry.

## üèóÔ∏è System Overview

The following diagram provides an overview of the main components and data flow across the architecture:

This design integrates containerized microservices, AI-driven inference modules, and software-defined networking (SDN) controllers to support **dynamic adaptation**, **federated learning**, and **real-time decision-making** within IIoT ecosystems.
